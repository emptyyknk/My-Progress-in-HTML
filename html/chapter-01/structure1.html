    <h2>HTML DESCRIBES THE STRUCTURE OF THE PAGES</h2>
    <p>The HTML code (in blue) is made up of characters that live inside angled brackets â€” these are called HTML <b>elements</b>. Elements are usually made up of two <b>tags</b>: an opening tag and a closing tag. (The closing tag has an extra forward slash in it.) Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that sits between its opening and closing tags.</p>

    <h2>HTML USES ELEMENTS TO DESCRIBE THE STRUCURE OF PAGES</h2>
    <p>
        Let's look closer at the code from the last page. There are several different elements. Each element has an opening tag and a closing tag.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.
    </p>

    <h2>ATTRIBUTE TELL US MORE ABOUT ELEMENTS</h2>
    <p>Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a</p><p style="color: darkgreen;">name</p><p>and a</p><p style="color: lightcoral;">value</p>

    <h2>Body, Head, and Title</h2>
    <p><code>< body> </code></p>
    <p>
        You met the <code>< body></code> element in the first example we created. Everything inside this element is shown inside the main browser window.
    </p>
    <p><code>< head></code></p>
    <p>
        Before the < body> element you will often see a < head> element. This contains information
            about the page
    </p>
    <p><code>< title></code></p>
    <p>
        The contents of the < title> element are either shown in the top of the browser, above where you usually type in the URL of the page you want to visit, or
            on the tab for that page
    </p>
