        <li>Creating links between pages</li>
        <li>Linking to other site</li>
        <li>Email links</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Links are the defining feature of the web <br>
        because they allow you to move from <br> 
        one web page to another â€” enabling the <br> 
        very idea of browsing or surfing.
    </p>
    <p style="font-size: 13px;">You will commonly come across the following types of links:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Links from one website to another</li>
        <li>Links from one page to another on the same website</li>
        <li>Links from one part of a web page to another part of the <br>same page </li>
        <li>Links that open in a new browser window</li>
        <li>Links that start up your email program and address a new <br>email to someone</li>
    </ul>
    <br>

    <h2>WRITING LINKS</h2> <!-- Writing links -->
    <p>
        Links are created using the <code>< a></code> element. Users can click on anything <br>
        between the opening <code>< a></code> tag and the closing <code>< /a></code> tag. You specify <br>
        which page you want to link to using the <code>href</code> attribute.

    <br><h2>LINKING TO OTHER SITES</h2> <!-- Linking to other sites -->
    <h4><code>< a></code></h4>
    <p>
        Links are created using the <code>< a></code> <br> element which has an attribute <br> called <code>href</code>. The value of the <br> 
        <code>href</code> attribute is the page that <br> you want people to go to when <br> they click on the link.
    </p>
    <p>
        Users can click on anything that appears between the opening <code>< a></code> tag and the closing <code>< /a></code><br>
        tag and will be taken to the page specified in the href attribute.
    </p>
    <p>
        When you link to a different website, the value of the <code>href</code> <br>
        attribute will be the full web address for the site, which is known as an <b>absolute</b> URL.
    </p>
    <p style="color: silver; font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif;">
        Browsers show links in blue with an underline by default.
    </p>

    <p style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; color: slategrey;">
        ABSOLUTE URLS
    </p>
    <p>
        <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr> stands for Uniform Resource Locator. Every web page has its own URL. This is the <br>
        web address that you would type into a browser if you wanted to visit that specific page.
    </p>
    <p>
        An absolute URL starts with the domain name for that site, and can be followed by the path <br>
        to a specific page. If no page is specified, the site will display the homepage.
    </p>

    <h2>LINKING TO OTHER PAGES ON THE SAME SITE</h2> <!-- Linking to other pages on the same site -->
    <h4><code>< a></code></h4>
    <p>
        When you are linking to other pages within the same site, you do not need to specify <br> 
        the domain name in the URL. You can use a shorthand known as a <b>relative</b> URL. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If all the pages of the site are in the same folder, then the value <br>
        of the <code>href</code> attribute is just the name of the file.
    </p> 
    <p>
        If you have different pages of a site in different folders, then you can use a slightly more complex <br>
        syntax to indicate where the page is in relation to the current page. You will learn more about these on the pages 81-84.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you look at the download code for each chapter, you will <br> see that the <code>index.html</code> file contains links that use relative URLs.
    </p>

        RELATIVE URLS
    </p>
    <p>
        When linking to other pages within the same site, you can use relative URLs. These are like a shorthand version of absolute URLs because you do not need to specify the domain name. <br>
        We will take a closer look at relative URLs on pages 83-84 as there are several helpful shortcuts you can use to write links to other pages on your own website. <br>
        Relative URLs help when building a site on your computer because you can create links between pages without having to set up your domain name or hosting.

    <h2>DIRECTORY STRUCTURE</h2> <!-- Directory structure -->
    <p>
        On larger websites it's a good idea to organize your code by placing the <br> pages for each different section of the site into a new folder. Folders on a <br>
        website are sometimes referred to as directories.
    </p>

    <!-- Structure -->
    <p style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; color: slategrey;">
        STRUCTURE
    </p>
    <p>
        The diagram on the right shows the directory structure for a fictional entertainment listings website called ExampleArts.
    </p>
    <p>
        The top-level folder is known as the <b>root</b> folder. (In this example, the root folder is called <i><b>examplearts</b></i>.) The root folder contains all of the other files and folders for a website.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each section of the site is placed in a separate folder; this helps organize the files.
    </p>

    <!-- Relationship -->
    <p style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; color: slategrey;">
        RELATIONSHIP
    </p>
    <p>
        The relationship between files and folders on a website is described using the same terminology as a family tree.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the diagram on the right, you can see some relationships have been drawn in.
    </p>
    <p>
        The <i><b>examplearts</b></i> folder is a parent of the <i><b>movies</b></i>, <i><b>music</b></i> and <i><b>theater</b></i> folders. And the the <i><b>movies</b></i>, <i><b>music</b></i> and <i><b>theater</b></i> folders are children of the <i><b>examplearts</b></i> folder.
    </p>

    <!-- Homepages -->
    <p style="font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif; color: slategrey;">
        HOMEPAGES
    </p>
    <p>
        The main homepage of a site written in HTML (and the homepages of each section in a child folder) is called <i><b>index.html</b></i>.
    </p>
    <p>
        Web servers are usually set up to return the <i><b>index.html</b></i> file if no file name is specified.
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, if you enter <code>examplearts.com</code> it will return <code>examplearts.com/index.html</code>, and <code>examplearts.com/music</code> will return <code>examplearts.com/music/index.html</code>.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>If you are working with a content management system, blogging software, or an e-commerce system, you might not have individual files for each page of the website. <br>
            Instead, these systems often use one template file for each different type of page (such as news articles, blog posts, or products). <br> 
            Editing the template file would change all of the pages that use that template. Do not change any code that is not HTML or you may break the page.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
        Every page and every image on a website has a <b><abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr></b>. The URL is made up of the domain name followed by the <b>path</b> to that page or image.
    </p>
    <p>
        The path to the homepage of this site is <code>www.examplearts.com/index.html</code>. The path to the logo for the site is <code>examplearts.com/images/logo.gif</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
        You use URLs when linking to other web pages and when including images in your own site. On the next page, you will meet a shorthand way to link to files on your own site.

    <!-- Relative URLs -->
    <h2 style="font-family: 'Lucida Sans', 'Lucida Sans Regular', 'Lucida Grande', 'Lucida Sans Unicode', Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif;">RELATIVE URLS</h2>
    <p style="font-family: 'Gill Sans', 'Gill Sans MT', Calibri, 'Trebuchet MS', sans-serif; color: slategray;">
        Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to find your files.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        When you are linking to a page on your own website, you do <br>
        not need to specify the domain name. You can use <b>relative URLs</b> <br>
        which are a shorthand way to tell the browser where a page is in relation to the current page.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is especially helpful when creating a new website or learning about HTML because <br> 
        you can create links between pages when they are only on your personal computer <br> 
        (before you have got a domain name and uploaded them to the web).
    </p>
    <p>
        Because you do not need to repeat the domain name in each link, they are also quicker to write.
    </p>
    <p>
        If all of the files in your site are in one folder, you simply use the file name for that page.
    </p>
    <p>
        If your site is organized into separate folders (or directories), <br> 
        you need to tell the browser how to get from the page it is <br> 
        currently on to the page that you are linking to.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you link to the same page from two different pages you might, <br> 
        therefore, need to write two different relative URLs.
    </p>
    <p>
        These links make use of the same terminology (borrowed from that of family trees) <br> 
        you met on the previous page which introduces directory structure.
    </p>

    <p>
        When a website is live (that is, uploaded to a web server) you may see a couple of other techniques used that do not work when the files are on your local computer. <br><br>
        For example, you may see the name of a child folder without the name of a file. In this case the web server will usually try to show the homepage for that section. <br><br>
        A forward slash will return the homepage for the entire site, and a forward slash followed by a file name will return that file providing it is in the root directory.
    </p> <br>
    
    <!-- Email links-->
    <h2>EMAIL LINKS</h2>
    <h4><code>mailto: </code></h4>
    <p>
        To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified <br>
        email address, you use the <code>< a></code> element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts <br>
        with <code>mailto:</code> and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.
    </p>
    <p>
        On the right you can see that an email link looks just like any other link but, when it is clicked <br>
        on, the user's email program will open a new email message and address it to the person <br>
        specified in the link.

    <!-- Opening links in a new window -->
    <h2>OPENING LINKS IN A NEW WINDOW</h2>
    <h4><code>target</code></h4>
    <p>
        If you want a link to open in a new window, you can use the <code>target</code> attribute on the opening <code>< a></code> tag. The value of this attribute should be <code>_blank</code>. <br><br>
        One of the most common reasons a web page author might want a link to be opened in a new window is if it points to another website. In such cases, <br>
        they hope the user will return to the window containing their site after finishing looking at the other one.
    </p>
    <blockquote>
        <p style="color: slategray; font-style: unset;">
            Generally you should avoid opening links in a new window, but if you do, it is considered
            <br> good practice to inform users that the link will open a new window before they click on it.

    <!-- Linking to specific part of the same page -->
    <h2>LINKING TO SPECIFIC PART OF THE SAME PAGE</h2>
    <p>
        At the top of a long page you might want to add a list of contents that links to the corresponding sections lower down. Or you 
        <br> might want to add a link from part way down the page back to the top of it to save users from having to scroll back to the top. <br><br>
        
        Before you can link to a specific part of a page, you need to identify the points in the page that the link will go to. You do this using the id attribute (which can be  <br>
        used on every HTML element). You can see that the <code>< h1></code> and <code>< h2></code> elements in this example have been given id attributes that identify those sections of the page. <br><br>

        The value of the <code>id</code> attribute should start with a letter or an underscore (not a number or any other character) and, on a single page, no two <code>id</code> attributes should have the same value. <br><br>
        
        To link to an element that uses an <code>id</code> attribute you use the <code>< a></code> element again, but the value of the href attribute starts with the # symbol, followed by the value of the<br>
        id attribute of the element you want to link to. In this example, <code>< a href="#top"></code> links to the <code>< h1></code> element at the top of the page whose id attribute has a value of top.
